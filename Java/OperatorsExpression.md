## Operators

operators are symbols which will perform operation

int a=10;
int b=20;

int c= a+b;

Here a,b,c are operands
=,+ are operator

## Types of operators


## 1) Arithmetic Operators
Used to perform mathematical operations.

`+`  Addition  
`-`  Subtraction  
`*`  Multiplication  
`/`  Division  
`%`  Modulus (Remainder)

## 2) Relational / Comparison Operators - used for any type of data,int string

`>`   Greater than  
`<`   Less than  
`>=`  Greater than or equal to  
`<=`  Less than or equal to  
`!=`  Not equal to  
`==`  Equal to

`&&`  Logical AND  
`||`  Logical OR  
 '!' Not

---

## 4) Increment & Decrement Operators

`++`  Increment  
`--`  Decrement  

There are 2 types

`=`   Assign  
`+=`  Add and assign  
`-=`  Subtract and assign  
`*=`  Multiply and assign  
`/=`  Divide and assign  
`%=`  Modulus and assign

`?:`
syntax:
var = exp?result1:reult2;
