## What is Java?

Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language used to develop web, desktop, and mobile applications.
It follows the principle: Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA).

## Types of Programming Languages
1.Structured Programming
Focuses on functions and procedures.
Does not use classes and objects.
Example: C

2.Object-Based Programming
Supports only class and object.
Does not fully support all OOP concepts.

3.Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Supports all six OOPS concepts:

    Class
    Object
    Inheritance
    Polymorphism
    Abstraction
    Encapsulation

Example: Python can be used in all three ways.

## Java Features

1.Platform Independent
Java code written on one OS can run on another without changes.
Achieved using JVM.

2.Case-Sensitive
Java differentiates between uppercase and lowercase letters.
Example: int number and int Number are different.

## OOP Concepts in Java

Class – Blueprint of object
Object – Instance of class
Inheritance – One class acquires another class properties
Polymorphism – One method, many behaviors
Abstraction – Hiding implementation details
Encapsulation – Binding data and methods together

## Java Components
1.JDK (Java Development Kit)

Used to develop applications.
Contains JRE + compiler.

2.JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

Used to run Java applications.
Contains JVM + libraries.

3.JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

Executes Java bytecode.
Makes Java platform independent.
